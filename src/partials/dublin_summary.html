<p>Dublin is the crossroads where the best of US and European tech collides. We are proud to join some of the best companies in the world at our Silicon Docks office, which opened in April 2015. Located at Grand Canal Dock, the office is a legendary space in the local tech scene, and an historical building to boot. Overlooking the water, with spectacular natural light, it's the perfect space for the best minds to leverage the best data as we disrupt how the world connects to fashion.</p>
