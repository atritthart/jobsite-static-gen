<p>Zalando’s office in Dortmund opened its doors in July 2012 and has since become the engineering epicenter of our payments and tooling operations. With nearly 50 tech employees, the office offers a somewhat cozier and more intimate atmosphere than our Berlin location. You’ll easily get to know all of your colleagues on a first-name basis &mdash; especially through fun team activities like foosball and paper-airplane contests &mdash; and even get the opportunity to organize team outings to catch the local soccer team, BVB 09. With more than half a million inhabitants, Dortmund offers a thriving technology scene as well as many cultural attractions and a high quality of life for Zalandos seeking a quieter alternative to the capital.</p>
