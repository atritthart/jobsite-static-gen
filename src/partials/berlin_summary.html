<p>Located just blocks away from Berlin’s famous Alexanderplatz commercial hub, Zalando's primary tech office is a center of constant innovation and buzz. Here’s where you’ll find hundreds of our technologists busily working on the apps, algorithms and other aspects of Zalando’s complex operations. Some of the Berlin office’s notable features include our ninth-floor Sky Lounge, whose views add a dramatic backdrop to our tech meetups; a brand-new food court and adjoining chill-out area with video game station and pool table; our Innovation Lab, and a band rehearsal space. Bikes, massages, a mail room, and a constant supply of fresh fruits and drinks make working here comfy and convenient.</p>
