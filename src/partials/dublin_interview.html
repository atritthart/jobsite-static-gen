<h1>How did you end up here?</h1>
<p>My lead asked me, I said yes! It is kind of crazy, really. I joined the company 2 1/2 years ago in Berlin. Now I am here and can be part of starting something completely new and exciting. Can't wait to see what the next 2 1/2 years will bring!</p>
<h1>What are the best things about Dublin?</h1>
<p>The people, to be honest. So far everyone has been so very welcoming and friendly it is almost shocking to me. And really, no superficial friendliness - but people actually really care and try to help where they can.</p>
<h1>What's it like working in the tech scene in this city?</h1>
<p>It feels grand. The tech scene is very well connected and quite big. Everyone knows everyone somehow - 2 separations, max.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the fact that everyone you meet is really motivated and interested in technology. They want to learn more, get better in what they are doing and are eager to explore new technologies. 
Also folks over here really are looking for cool and interesting products. That's why I am even more excited that Zalando opened up a tech hub over here. If we are able to provide the best products, we will also be able to work with the best talents.</p>
<h1>What challenges did you face after moving to Dublin?</h1>
<p>You know how it is, new city, new country - that is always challenging. What seems to be a little more tricky than the regular bureaucratic insanity though, is the apartment situation. Especially on the letting end the offer is lower than the demand. But the good thing is that the company is helping me out here and temporarily provides a flat for me until I found my own.</p>
<h1>What would you recommend for someone who just moved here?</h1>
<p>Meet the locals! Sure, also go by temple bar, fair enough. But the biggest asset this city has to offer are its people. Check out not just the city centre but also its surrounding. Attend meet-ups, set up coffee and lunch dates, the personal contact is super helpful in Dublin, and as mentioned before, people are actually really nice, so it is a lot of fun as well.For me another highlight is the fact that you can just walk from the city directly up to the Sea, so I would recommend extended beach walks as soon as the sun is out!</p>
