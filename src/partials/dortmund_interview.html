<h1>How did you end up here?</h1>
<p>My wife is a Zalando customer, and when the Dortmund office opened in 2012 she thought it would be pretty cool for her to be able to shop with an employee discount. What I found more interesting than Zalando’s discount was its technology, so I applied for an engineering position. After a few telephone interviews and face-to-face interviews, voilà: I became a member of Zalando. That was in November 2012.</p>
<h1>What are the best things about Dortmund?</h1>
<p>When I moved to Dortmund in 1995, this city was nothing more than coal and steel. Slowly its beauty has revealed itself to me. Its moving history, aspirations for a better future and welcoming people make this city special. And, of course, there’s the soccer team, and the fans who support it in times good and bad. Dortmund is a very green city, with many parks and lakes that where you can rest and refresh your energy. I really like it here.</p>
<h1>What's it like working in the tech scene in this city?</h1>
<p>Dortmund is a part of the Ruhrgebiet (Ruhr Valley). The city borders are very seamless, which makes our tech scene relevant to the whole surrounding region. Many of our universities offer technical institutions such as Ruhruniversiät in Bochum or Technical University in Dortmund. Graduates often work in one of the many IT and telecommunication companies; this creates the flourishing basis for a lively tech scene. A lot of companies host active user groups that organize interesting technical workshops and events.</p>
<h1>What challenges did you face after moving to Dortmund?</h1>
<p>I moved to Dortmund from the Ukraine. Back then, my biggest challenge was the language. Also: How do I find a flat? How do I sign up my child for kindergarten? A lot of questions. I know that many of my colleagues at Zalando had similar questions when they moved here, but we all help each other to adjust and adapt.</p>
<h1>What advice would you offer to someone who moves here?</h1>
<p>Learn German! That opens a lot of doors and makes life a lot easier. Be open to new things. Build a network; that sound really general, but it helps a lot. And if the streets suddenly turn black and yellow with cheering people, become one of them and celebrate the victory of their favorite team. And enjoy a yummy currywurst with french fries ;-).</p>
