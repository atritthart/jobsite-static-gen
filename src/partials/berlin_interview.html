<h1>How did you end up here?</h1>
<p>Accident and good luck. In September 2014 I was looking for a vacation destination and the cheapest flight from NYC was to Berlin. I’d been here once before and heard great things about the tech scene, so I bought the ticket and visited in November 2014. While here I met with some Zalando leaders after being e-introduced to them by a former colleague and current Zalando. We spent several hours chatting and got along, they made the offer, I accepted, and BOOM. I was working for a great company in NYC, but the energy, growth and culture of Zalando was too amazing to ignore.</p>
<h1>What are the best things about Berlin?</h1>
<p>Almost everything. But to single out a few: Diversity, affordability, architecture, parks, bicycle lanes everywhere, and people who are as fascinating as they are friendly (very).</p>
<h1>What's it like working in the tech scene in this city?</h1>
<p>Everyone knows Zalando, but they don’t know as much about Zalando tech. I’ve enjoyed telling strangers about how complex and innovative we are as a tech company--they are often surprised.</p>
<h1>What challenges did you face after moving to Berlin?</h1>
<p>The apartment quest is a tough one--it feels more like a talent show than a business transaction. The language difference can be hard--not in tech so much, because we speak English--but when doing banking or reading public signs. I’m using DuoLingo to learn German and this is helping a lot.</p>
<h1>What would you recommend for someone who just moved here?</h1>
<p>Learn German! Learn about Germany and integrate as much as you can. Stretch yourself socially--make friends with people from your own culture, from Germany, and from the many other nationalities represented within the city limits. Enjoy this amazing time in Berlin’s history--it’s a privilege to witness and a joy to experience.</p>
